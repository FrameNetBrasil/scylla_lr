# Scylla: domain adaptation using frames and qualia

## API usage
1. Set up a Google API Key and enable it for the translation service. 
- This key can be generated by creating the credentials on Google Cloud console, see the “Google Cloud Console page” at (https://cloud.google.com/cloud-console) for more information.
- Access the URL:

http://server3.framenetbr.ufjf.br:9600/inject?set_gtrans_key=<key>

e.g:
http://server3.framenetbr.ufjf.br:9600/inject?set_gtrans_key=AIzaSyCeBay2LRY7DVB_4FUZpaxeq6rsGMJhVEZ

2. Testing Scylla
	. Use API service "inject", e.g.

http://server3.framenetbr.ufjf.br:9600//inject?sentence=o%20atacante%20marcou%20um%20gol&from_lang=pt&to_lang=en&method=post

Parameters for experiments:
- sentence: the sentence in the source language;
- from_lang: source language - "pt" (for Brazilian Portuguese);
- to_lang - target language - "en" (for English);
- method - define the method for injection:
  - Scylla-T: method = post
  - Scylla-S: method = pre

The result of the request is a JSON Array containing the top results from the injection. Each JSON Object has the following properties:

- original_sentence - sentence in the source language given as input for the injection;
- translation_sentence - translation in the target language for the sentence given as input;
- injected_sentence - resulting translation after passing through the injection process;
- rank - rank of the resulting translation from injection;
- injections - number of injections made by the algorithm in the resulting translation.

## Dataset

Dataset contains the files used for experiments:

- File A – Source sentences: 50 Sentences of the Sports domain in Portuguese
- File B - Gold standard translations: Reference Translations of the source sentences translated into English by a professional native speaker translator
- File C - Baseline System output: MT translations of the source sentences, translated into English by the Baseline System (NMT API)
- File C1 - Baseline system output sentences edited by Editor 1 for calculating HTER
- File C2 - Baseline system output sentences edited by Editor 2 for calculating HTER
- File C3 - Baseline system output sentences edited by Editor 2 for calculating HTER
- File D - Scylla-S output: MT translations of the source sentences, translated into English by Scylla-S
- File D1 - Scylla-S output sentences edited by Editor 1 for calculating HTER
- File D2 - Scylla-S output sentences edited by Editor 2 for calculating HTER
- File D3 - Scylla-S output sentences edited by Editor 2 for calculating HTER
- File E - Scylla-T output: MT translations of the source sentences, translated into English by Scylla-T
- File D1 - Scylla-T output sentences edited by Editor 1 for calculating HTER
- File D2 - Scylla-T output sentences edited by Editor 2 for calculating HTER
- File D3 - Scylla-T output sentences edited by Editor 2 for calculating HTER

## Database

Daisy processing access directly a FrameNet database to get the wordforms, lexemes, lemmas, LUs and frames. 
For sake of completion, a database dump is available in this repository.
